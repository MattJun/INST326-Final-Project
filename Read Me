For the code to work, you need to download Schedule.xlsx which can be found in our links on this GitHub.

If you are adding someone to the schedule through the code, you must seperate the times they can work with a comma. so if you want to work
from 9-11; you must write "9,10,11"

In order for the test to work you must run it with an unchanged schedule, without having added anyone to it.
